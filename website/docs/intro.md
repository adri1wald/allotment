# Tutorial Intro

Let's discover **Allotment in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Create React App is an officially supported way to create single-page React applications. It offers a modern build setup with no configuration. We'll use it to create an application to which we'll add Allotment.

## Create a new application

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

## Start your site

Then open `http://localhost:3000/` to see your app.
